    Week 1: Address Book Exercise

    Address book

    Requirements

    You are required to produce a working console program that can store and manage a simple address book.
    
    The program will support the following functionality:

        Add a new contact to the book
        List the contacts in the book
        Search for contacts by name
    
    Two different kinds of contacts exist. 
        Personal contacts have the following attributes:

            Name
            Address
            Phone number

        Business contacts have the following attributes:

            Name
            Company
            Phone number
            Fax number

    Additional functionality

    You can optionally add the following functionality to the program:

        Delete a contact from the book, given its name
        Edit the information of a contact in the book, given its name
        Save/load the address book to/from a disk file
    
    Hints

    Even though it is possible to use a procedural approach to solve this problem, 
    for this exercise you MUST use inheritance and polymorphism!

    Use a collection from System.Collections.Generic for type safety

    Use LINQ to query the collection of contacts.

    In order to persist data to a disk file, you can use object serialization or an XML reader/writer
    in System.Xml
